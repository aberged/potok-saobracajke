"""Writes src/views/icons.ts from Potok's copy of Heroicons, so the app draws
the same icons as the page. Heroicons comes with potok-ide's dependencies:
run `mix deps.get` there first, with potok-ide next to this project, then
`python scripts/icons.py` here. Heroicons is MIT licensed by Tailwind Labs;
